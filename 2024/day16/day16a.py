Solution for Day 16 Part A

Walk through the maze - based on depth-first search (DFS)
or breadth-first search (BFS) as basic algorithms.

I did todayÂ´s solution with the help of chatGPT :-)
Lessons learned:
 - depth-first search (DFS) algorithm
 - breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm
 - chaining return statement
 - easy copy of a list
 - deque vs list
 - stack vs queue

 -> The BFS works fine for the two examples, but is too costly for the full-scale problem. Could not return result
    even after 1 hour :D
 -> switch to Dijkstra algorithm instead, but this one is beyond my knowledge :-), so chatGPT helped a lot.
